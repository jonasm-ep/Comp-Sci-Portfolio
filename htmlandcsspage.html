	<h1>What is HTML and CSS?</h1>
	<ol>
	 <div><li style="font-family:Verdana"><strong>What is HTML?</strong>
	  <ul>
	   <div><li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li></div>
	   <div><li>HTML is used to create Web documents to be used online, every page you see on the internet is made from HTML.</li></div>
       <div><li>HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN using SGML in 1992 and from that point on, html has evolved from using a few tags to having a complex system of markup.</li></div>
       <div><li>HTML is written through a bunch of tags with each tag telling the browser what to do with the text on the webpage.</li></div>
      </ul></div>
      <div><li style="font-family:Verdana"><strong>What is CSS?</strong>
	  <ul>
	    <div><li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li></div>
	    <div><li>CSS is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.  </li></div>
	    <div><li>CSS came from when some Web page writers started complaining about how they couldn't influence much on what their webpages looked like, so CSS was created.</li></div>
	    <div><li>CSS is written starting a with a selector and then information that is placed next to it inside a pair a of brackets.</li></div>
	  </ul></div>  
	  <div><li style="font-family:Verdana"><strong>How do tags work?</strong>
	   <ul>
	       <div><li>What is a tag? Well, tags refer to the markup language used to write HTML. Tags tell the browser to display whatever it says to the text on a webpage.</li></div>
	       <div><li>Tags in HTML use the "<" and the ">" that goes around a word that specifically tells what the web browser what it has to do with the text. Also, when the text is written after the tag, you have to end it by adding the same tag you started it and a "/" inside this tag to the left of the word. An exception of this rule would be the image tag which does not need this end tag, but only a "/" at the end of the tag.</li></div>
	   </ul></div>
      <div><li style="font-family:Verdana"><strong>What are attributes and how do they work?</strong>
       <ul>
            <div><li>Attributes are things like "href" or "id" which are placed inside tags to either link a text, add an image, or make a specific text be changed.</li></div>
            <div><li>Attributes have many functions in HTML and CSS. "id" and "class" are attributes that are used for a piece of text or image which gives the writer the ability to code the text in a specific way in css without affecting the other text that are using same tags. Another function of attributes is that by using the attribute "src" and then a url, you can get an image into your website. You can also use the attribute "href" and then a web address to create a link onto your web page.</li></div>
	   </ul></div>
	   <div><li style="font-family:Verdana"><strong>4 Different tags</strong>
	    <ul>
	        <div><li>One of the most commonly used tag in HTML is the "div" tag which divides text from eachother so they don't merge.</li></div>
	        <div><li>The "ol" tag is the tag for making ordered lists which lists text in numbers. It is obviously used for listing.</li></div>
	        <div><li>Contrary to the ol tag, "ul" tag is the tag for making unordered lists which lists text in bullet points. (This is text itself is made of unorderd lists, there are no bullet points because of the "list-style-type:none" I used in the CSS.</li></div>
	        <div><li>The table tag itself explanatory as it is used to make table. Also, "td" tags, table data, is used for the text and images that are going to be used in a table.</li></div>
	    </ul>
