						<td><strong>Four bots are placed against eachother on random map and compete against eachother to gain the most gold in the round.</strong></td>

						<td><strong>To start a game, each of the four individuals must queue in their terminal and wait for the others to queue themselves. Once everyone's bot is queued, the round starts with the bots spawned on a random map.</strong></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>The bots must start by conquering mines from the goblins on the map and steal the opponent mines as well during the round. Each move by a bot is a turn. There are a total of 1200 turns per round. Every turn, each bot receives 1 gold per mine they own.</strong></td>

I programmed my bot to do multiple tasks including going to a tavern when its health is low, steal mines owned by other players, and attacking the players with the lowest health. We as a class used JavaScipt to program our bots.</strong></td>

In the checkGoodTarget function, it is shown that the function will return true (run the function) if the health of an enemy bot is less than 25 or else it will return false (not run the function). The next if statemenet basically tells the bot where to go to find the bot that he needs to attack if the function is runned. Bot.findPath is used to find the path from myPos (my bot's position) to the x and y positions of the enemyBots[target].</strong></td>

						<td>Above is one of the tasks I programmed my bot to do. This task tells my bot to go and heal at a tavern when its life is less than 61. The first if statement states that if my bot's health is at less than 61, the task is equal to nearest tavern. The next if statement is the one that does most of the work as it says that if the task is equal to the nearest tavern, the bot will "bot.findDistance" of the myPos to the nearestTavern.</td>
